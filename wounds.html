                    If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock.<br>
                    First, dial 102 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible.<br>
                    Check that there's nothing embedded in the wound.<br>
                    If there is, take care not to press down on the object.<br>
                    Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging<br>
                    to avoid putting pressure on the object itself.<br>
                    Do not try to remove it because it may be helping to slow down the bleeding.<br>
                    If nothing is embedded:<br>
                    <li>Apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible.<br> 
                    Continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops.</li>
                    <li>Use a clean dressing or any clean, soft material to bandage the wound firmly.</li>
                    <li>If bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound until the bleeding stops, and then apply another pad<br>
                    over the top and bandage it in place.<br>
                    Do not remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped.</li>
                    <p class="infotext">If a body part, such as a finger, has been severed,<br>
                    place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film. Do not wash the severed limb.<br>
                    the package in soft fabric and place in a container of crushed ice. Do not let the limb touch the ice.<br>
                    Make sure the severed limb goes with the patient to hospital.<br>
                    Always seek medical help for bleeding, unless it's minor.</p>

                    If someone has a burn or scald:<br>
                    <li>Cool the burn as quickly as possible with cool running water for at least 20 minutes, or until the pain is relieved.</li>
                    <li>Call 999 or seek medical help, if needed.</li>
                    <li>While cooling the burn, before the area begins to swell, carefully remove any clothing, unless it's attached to the skin.</li>
                    <li>If you're cooling a large burnt area, particularly in babies, children and elderly people,<br>
                    be aware that it may cause hypothermia <br>
                    (it may be necessary to stop cooling the burn to avoid hypothermial).</li>
                    <li>If the burn has cooled, cover it loosely with cling film. </li>
                    <li>If cling film isn't available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material. Wrapping tightly may lead to further injury.</li>
                    <li>Do not apply creams, lotions or sprays to the burn.</li>
                    <p class="infotext">If you are not sure if medical help is needed or what to do next, call 102</p>

        <p id="infoheader">Chemical burns</p>
        <p class="infotext">
        For chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to remove the chemical.<br>
        If possible, determine the cause of the injury.<br>
        In certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use.<br>
        Be careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary.
