                <p class="infotext">
                    A heart attack is one of the most common life-threatening heart conditions in the UK.<br>
                    If you think someone is having or has had a heart attack, call 102<br>
                    and then move them into a comfortable sitting position.<br>
                    Symptoms of a heart attack include:<br>
                    <li>Chest pain - the pain is usually located in the centre or left side of the chest<br>
                    and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing</li>
                    <li>Pain in other parts of the body - it can feel as if the pain is travelling from the chest down or both arms,<br>
                    or into the jaw, neck, back or abdomen (tummy)</li>
                    <li>Sit the person down and make them comfortable.</li>
                    <p class="infotext">If they can, it's best for them to sit on the floor with their knees bent and their head and shoulders supported.<br>
                    If possible, place cushions behind them or under their knees.<br>
                    If they're conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly,<br>
                    (unless you know they shouldn't take aspirin, for example if they are under 16 or they say they are allergic to it).<br>
                    If the person has any medication for angina, help them to take it.<br>
                    Monitor their vital signs, such as their breathing, until help arrives.<br>
                    If the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, open their airway, check their breathing and, if necessary, start CPR.<br>
                    Call 102 to tell them you think the person is now in cardiac arrest (their heart has stopped beating)</p>

                <p class="infotext">
                    If someone has had an electric shock, switch off the electrical current at the mains to break the contact<br>
                    between the person and the electrical supply.<br>
                    If you can't reach the mains supply:<br>
                    Do not go near or touch the person until you're sure the electrical supply has been switched off.<br>
                    Once the power supply has been switched off, and if the person isn't breathing, dial 999 to for an ambulance.<br>
                    Afterwards, seek medical help.

                    If someone is in difficulty in water, don't enter the water unless it's safe to do so. Don't put yourself at risk.<br>
                    Once the person is on land, you need to check if they're breathing. Ask someone to call 999 for medical help.<br>
                    If they're not breathing, open the airway and give 5 initial rescue breaths before starting CPR.<br>
                    Find out how to give CPR, including rescue breaths.<br>
                    If the person is unconscious but still breathing, put them into the recovery position with their head lower than their body<br>
                    and call an ambulance immediately.

            <p class="infotext">
                Poisoning is potentially life threatening.<br>
                Common causes of poisoning include:<br>
                <li>Swallowing a toxic substance, such as bleach</li>
                <li>Taking an overdose of a prescription medicine</li>
                <li>Eating something, like wild plants and fungi</li>
                <li>Alcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms.</li>
                <p class="infotext">If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 to get immediate medical help and advice.<br>
                The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation.
                The following advice is important:</p>
                <li>Find out what's been swallowed so you can tell the paramedic or doctor.</li>
                <li>Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to.</li>
                <li>Do not try to cause vomiting.</li>
                <li>Stay with the person, as their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious.</li>
                <li>If the person becomes unconscious while you're waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR.</li>
                <p class="infotext">Do not perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the person's mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison.<br>
                Do not leave them if they're unconscious: they could vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke.<br>
                If they do vomit naturally, try to collect some of it for the ambulance crew - this may help identify the cause of the poisoning.<br>
                If the patient is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and keep checking they're breathing normally.<br>
