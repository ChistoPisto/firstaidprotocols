                <p class="infotext">
                    If the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe.<br>
                    In situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves.<br>
                    If choking is mild:<br>
                    <li>Encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage.</li>
                    <li>Ask them to try to spit out the object if it's in their mouth.</li>
                    <li>Do not put your fingers in their mouth if you can't see the object, as you risk pushing it further down their mouth.</li>
                    <p class="infotext">If coughing doesn't work, start back blows.<br>
                    Hit them firmly on their back with the heel of your hand between the shoulder blades</p>

                <p class="infotext">
                    If choking is severe, the person won't be able to speak, cry, or breathe, and without help they'll eventually become unconscious.<br>
                    If coughing doesn't work start back blows.
                    <li>Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with 1 hand.</li>
                    <li>Lean the person forward so the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down.</li>
                    <li>Give up to 5 sharp blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand <br>(the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist).</li>
                    <li>Check if the blockage has cleared.</li>
                    <p class="infotext">If not, give up to 5 abdominal thrusts.
                    Do not give abdominal thrusts to babies under 1 year old or to pregnant women.<br>
                    To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn't in one of the above groups:</p>
                    <li>Stand behind the person who is choking.</li>
                    <li>Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward.</li>
                    <li>Clench 1 fist and place it just above the person's belly button.</li>
                    <li>Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards.</li>
                    <p class="infotext">Repeat this up to 5 times.<br>
                    The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all 5.<br>
                    If the person's airway is still blocked after trying back blows and abdominal thrusts:<br>
                    Call 102 and ask for an ambulance. Tell the 102 operator that the person is choking.<br></p>

            <p class="infotext">
                Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or eating certain foods.<br>
                The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance the person is allergic to (allergen).<br>
                During anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and throat may swell, obstructing their airway.<br>
                Call 102 immediately if you think someone is experiencing anaphylactic shock.<br>
                <li>Check if the person is carrying any medication.</li>
                <li>Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe.</li>
                <li>You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you're trained to do so, give it to them yourself.</li>
                <li>After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives.</li>
                <p class="infotext">All casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional<br>
                as soon as possible after the injection has been given.<br>
                Make sure they're comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive.<br>
                If they're conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them.</p>

                <p id="infoheader">Fractures</p>
                <p class="infotext">
                    It can be difficult to tell if a person has a broken bone or a joint, as opposed to a simple muscular injury.<br>
                    If you're in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone.<br>
                    If the person is unconscious or is bleeding heavily, these must be dealt with first by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure<br>
                    and performing CPR.<br>
                    See the section on bleeding heavily above.<br>
                    If the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible<br>
                    until you get them safely to hospital.<br>
                    Once you have done this, decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car.<br>
                    If the pain isn't too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car.<br>
                    Get someone else to drive if possible so you can care for the person who is injured during the trip.<br>
                    But call 102 if:
                    <li>They're in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication - call an ambulance and do not move them</li>
                    <li>It's obvious they have a broken leg - do not move them, but keep them in the position you found them in and call an ambulance</li>
                    <li>You suspect they have injured or broken their back - call an ambulance and do not move them</li>
                    <li>Do not give the person who is injured anything to eat or drink,<br>
                    as they may need an anaesthetic (numbing medication) when they reach hospital.</li>

                <p class="infotext">
                    In the case of a serious injury or illness, it's important to look out for signs of shock.<br>
                    Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body<br>
                    as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen.<br>
                    This is usually the result of severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack,<br>
                    a bacterial infection, or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).<br>
                    The type of shock described here isn't the same as the emotional response of feeling shocked, which can also occur after an accident.<br>
                    Signs of shock include:<br>
                    <li>pale, cold, clammy skin</li>
                    <li>sweating</li>
                    <li>rapid, shallow breathing</li>
                    <li>weakness and dizziness</li>
                    <li>feeling sick and possibly vomiting</li>
                    <li>thirst</li>
                    <li>yawning</li>
                    <li>sighing</li>
                    <p class="infotext">Seek medical help immediately if you notice that someone has any of these signs of shock.<br>
                    You should:</p>
                    <li>call 999 as soon as possible and ask for an ambulance</li>
                    <li>treat any obvious injuries</li>
                    <li>lie the person down if their injuries allow you to and, if possible, raise and support their legs</li>
                    <li>use a coat or blanket to keep them warm</li>
                    <li>do not give them anything to eat or drink</li>
                    <li>give them lots of comfort and reassurance</li>
                    <li>monitor the person - if they stop breathing, start CPR and call 999 to update them</li>
                </p>
