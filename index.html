        Every year, thousands of people die or are seriously injured in <br>
        incidents. Many deaths could be prevented if first aid was given before <br>
        emergency services arrive.</p>

    <p class="infotext">
        The primary goal of first aid is to prevent death or serious injury from worsening. The key aims of first aid can be summarized with the acronym of 'the three'.<br>
        <p class="infotextage">
            <b>Preserve life:</b> The top priority in any medical care, including first aid, is to save lives and reduce the risk of death.<br>
            It should also alleviate pain and provide comfort during treatment.<br>
            <b>Prevent further harm:</b> This involves actions like moving the injured away from danger and using first aid techniques to avoid worsening their condition,<br>
            such as applying pressure to stop bleeding.<br>
            <b>Promote recovery:</b> First aid initiates the process of recovery from injury or illness. This might involve basic treatments like applying a bandage to a small wound.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="infotext">It is important to note that first aid is not medical treatment and cannot be compared with what a trained medical professional provides.<br>
        First aid involves making common sense decisions in the best interest of an injured person.
